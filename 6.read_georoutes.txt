#Great Circles

#On a two-dimensional map, the great circle is demonstrated as a line because it is projected from three-dimensional down to two-dimensional using the map projection. We can use these to visualize the flight routes from the routes dataframe. To plot great circles, we need the source longitude, source latitude, destination longitude, and the destination latitude for each route. While the routes dataframe contains the source and destination airports for each route, the latitude and longitude values for each airport are in a separate dataframe (airports).

#To make things easier, we've created a new CSV file called geo_routes.csv that contains the latitude and longitude values corresponding to the source and destination airports for each route. We've also removed some columns we won't be working with.
