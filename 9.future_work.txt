In this mission, we learned how to visualize geographic data using basemap. This is the last mission in the Storytelling Through Data Visualization course. You should now have a solid foundation in data visualization for exploring data and communicating insights. We encourage you to keep exploring data visualization on your own. Here are some suggestions for what to do next:

Plotting tools:
Creating 3D plots using Plotly
Creating interactive visualizations using bokeh
Creating interactive map visualizations using folium
The art and science of data visualization:
Visual Display of Quantitative Information
Visual Explanations: Images and Quantities, Evidence and Narrative
